If you create an account, you can save your favorite artists and venues for later.

## Development

This project was developed with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
Because Next comes out of the box with a pre-configured back-end, an additional custom back-end framework, like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) was not necessary. [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example)was used to handle user authentication.

I also utlize [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database. The database is housed on my local machine.
