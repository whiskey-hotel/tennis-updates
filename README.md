# Upcoming Events

Wondering when your favorite band is in town? This project aims to simplify that process.
This project utilizes the [SongKit](https://www.songkick.com/) API to determine when your favorite artist is performing.

You can search for upcoming events by:
- The artists touring calendar
- The schedule of your favorite venue
- Known events occuring in your favorite metro area
- Or based on a specific date that fits your schedule

If you create an account, you can save your favorite artists and venues for later.

## Development

This project was developed with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
Because Next comes out of the box with a pre-configured back-end, an additional custom back-end framework, like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) was not necessary. [next-auth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example)was used to handle user authentication.

I also utlize [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database. The database is housed on my local machine.
